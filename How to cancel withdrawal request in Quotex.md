## What Is a Withdrawal Request in Quotex?

A **withdrawal request** in Quotex is a formal instruction to transfer funds from your trading account to an external payment method (like **Mpesa**, bank transfer, crypto wallet, etc.). Once you submit the request, Quotex queues the transaction for processing.

However, the request does not immediately move your funds. There is a **short window before processing** begins‚Äîthis is the only time you can cancel it.

## Why Would You Cancel a Withdrawal Request?

There are several valid reasons why you may want to **cancel a withdrawal request in Quotex**:

- You spot a promising trade setup and want to reallocate funds quickly.
- You realize the payment method was incorrect or outdated.
- You forgot to complete your **KYC verification**, causing delays.
- You want to consolidate your withdrawals for a larger sum later.
- You made a mistake in the withdrawal amount or currency.

Cancelling a request lets you re-evaluate your **capital allocation strategy** without losing time or incurring unnecessary processing costs.

## Can You Cancel a Withdrawal in Quotex?

Yes, **you can cancel a withdrawal in Quotex**, but only **before** it enters the **processed** status. After that point, the request is considered irreversible.

### The status stages are:

- **Pending**: Request submitted but not processed ‚Äì can be canceled.
- **Processing**: Being reviewed or executed ‚Äì usually cannot be canceled.
- **Completed**: Funds have been sent ‚Äì irreversible.
- **Rejected**: Rejected by system or support ‚Äì no need to cancel.
  
Act fast if you want to cancel. Most withdrawal requests on Quotex are processed **within 1‚Äì3 hours**, though some methods may take longer.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Cancel a Withdrawal Request in Quotex

Follow these simple steps to stop a withdrawal from being executed:

### Step 1: Log into Your Quotex Account

Access your dashboard by logging in. [**Open Quotex Account**](https://broker-qx.pro/sign-up/?lid=933307) if you haven‚Äôt registered yet.

### Step 2: Navigate to Transaction History

In the dashboard, go to your profile or click the balance section. Look for **Transaction History**.

### Step 3: Filter by Withdrawal

Use the filters to narrow your search to **withdrawals only**.

### Step 4: Check Status

Locate the withdrawal you want to cancel. Check if the status is still **Pending**.

### Step 5: Click ‚ÄúCancel‚Äù or Contact Support

If a ‚ÄúCancel‚Äù button is available next to the transaction, click it. If not, contact **Quotex Support via Live Chat** immediately and request cancellation.

## What Happens After Cancellation?

When you cancel a withdrawal:

- The requested amount is returned to your Quotex trading balance.
- You can instantly reuse the funds for new trades or initiate a new withdrawal.
- No fees are charged for the cancellation itself.
- You'll receive an email confirmation.

## Best Practices: When Should You Cancel a Withdrawal?

Cancelling should be part of a well-considered strategy, not a habit. Some good reasons to cancel include:

- **Reacting to market volatility**: A sudden price movement presents a trading opportunity.
- **Avoiding delays**: You submitted without completing **KYC**, so cancel to prevent rejection.
- **Payment method change**: You want to use a faster or more convenient withdrawal channel.

## When You Should NOT Cancel a Withdrawal

- You‚Äôre unsure of your reasons.
- You're panicking due to market losses.
- You‚Äôre under the influence of emotional trading.
- You plan to ‚Äúgamble‚Äù with the funds you initially intended to withdraw.

Remember, **emotional trading decisions** often lead to long-term losses. Cancelling a withdrawal should be tactical, not impulsive.

## Frequently Made Mistakes

Even experienced traders sometimes mess up the process. Here's what to avoid:

- **Waiting too long**: Once processing starts, cancellation is impossible.
- **Not monitoring withdrawal statuses**.
- **Attempting to cancel processed requests**‚Äîthis wastes time.
- **Ignoring confirmation messages** or emails from Quotex.

## Contacting Support to Cancel Withdrawal

If there's no visible cancel button:

3. Be polite and clear. Support agents prioritize urgent actions.
4. Request written confirmation once the cancellation is done.

## How Long Does It Take to Cancel?

If you're quick, **cancellation is instant** through the dashboard. If via support, it may take 10‚Äì30 minutes depending on the load.

After cancellation, the funds are **reinstated immediately** in your Quotex balance.

## Reallocating Funds After Cancellation

Once funds are back, consider these smart options:

- **Reinvest** in high-probability trades.
- **Switch withdrawal method** for faster processing (e.g., Mpesa over bank).
- **Increase position size** in a trending market.
- **Hold funds** for planned withdrawals later in the week.

Having this level of **liquidity control** gives you an edge in dynamic markets.
