## Is Quotex Legal in Sri Lanka? ‚úÖ

As of now, **Quotex** operates in a **gray area** in Sri Lanka. There is no clear legal framework in Sri Lanka specifically governing binary options trading. However, Sri Lankan traders can access **Quotex** without facing immediate legal repercussions, as the platform itself operates globally.
