However, it‚Äôs worth noting that the platform does take steps to ensure **user security** through encryption and other technological measures.

**Tip:** While a lack of regulation doesn't necessarily make a platform a scam, it is something to be aware of when making your decision. Always ensure you understand the risks involved with unregulated platforms. ‚úÖ
