## Limited Asset Variety

One of the primary disadvantages of Quotex is its **limited asset variety**. While the platform provides a range of financial instruments like currency pairs, commodities, and indices, its offering is significantly smaller compared to other popular trading platforms.

**üí•Why is this an issue?**
The withdrawal process is crucial for any trading platform. Delays or issues in withdrawing funds could cause serious concerns for traders who need fast access to their earnings.

---

## Limited Mobile App Features

Although Quotex offers a mobile app for trading, it lacks some of the **advanced features** available on the desktop version of the platform. The app can feel somewhat limiting and may not provide the same level of functionality for active traders.

**‚è©Mobile Trading Experience:**
If you‚Äôre someone who prefers to trade on the go, the limitations of the Quotex mobile app could affect your ability to make quick decisions and monitor your trades effectively.
