## Best 1 Minute Strategy Setup for Quotex

Here’s a tried-and-true trading setup you can implement:

**Indicators:**
- EMA 5 (green)  
- EMA 13 (red)  
- RSI (7) with levels 30/70  
- Bollinger Bands (20,2)

**Conditions to Enter a Trade:**
- Wait for **EMA crossover** (EMA 5 crosses EMA 13 from below = Call; from above = Put)  
- RSI should support the trend (i.e., RSI above 50 for Call)  
- Price touches lower Bollinger Band (for Call) or upper (for Put)  
- Entry should be in the **direction of trend**

This strategy offers **high probability signals**, especially during **volatile sessions** (e.g., London or New York sessions).

## The Importance of Timing in 1-Minute Trades

**Timing is everything**. The success of this strategy relies heavily on when you execute your trades:

- **Trade during high volume sessions** (e.g., overlapping market hours)  
- **Avoid low liquidity periods** (weekends, late hours)

Stick to **fixed time trades** with clear expiration rather than open-ended trades. This removes emotional trading.

This style of trading can be risky. Without discipline, you may burn your account quickly. Here’s how to manage your bankroll:

- Risk only **1-2% per trade**  
- Use the **Martingale system cautiously** (double after loss)  
- Set daily **win/loss limits**  
- Withdraw profits regularly

## Trading Psychology: Mastering Emotions in 60 Seconds
