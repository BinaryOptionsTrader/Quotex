## 💥 What is Quotex?

**Quotex** is a *digital options trading platform* that allows users to trade a variety of assets including **currencies**, **cryptocurrencies**, **commodities**, and **indices**. It’s known for:

✅ *Simple and user-friendly interface*  
✅ *Fast execution speed*  
✅ *Low deposit requirement (from $10)*  
✅ *Free demo account for practice*

Unlike traditional stock trading, Quotex focuses on **short-term price movements** where traders predict whether an asset’s price will go *up or down* in a set period — usually between 1 to 5 minutes.

> 💡 *“It’s not about predicting the future — it’s about understanding the present.”*

## ⏩ How Does Quotex Work?

Here’s how it works in a nutshell:

1. **Choose an Asset** – Like EUR/USD, Bitcoin, or Gold.
2. **Set the Timeframe** – From 1 minute to 4 hours.
3. **Enter Your Trade Amount** – Minimum $1.
4. **Predict Direction** – *Up (Call)* or *Down (Put)*.
5. **Wait and Win/Lose** – If your prediction is correct, you win up to **98% return**.

🔥 *Example:*  
You place a $10 "Up" trade on EUR/USD for 1 minute. If it ends higher after that minute, you get $19.60 back (your $10 + 96% profit).
