## How the Quotex 5 Second Strategy Works 🔥

Let’s break it down step by step. This strategy isn’t just about speed — it’s about **precision and psychology**.

### Step 1: Use a 1-Second Candle Chart

Quotex allows you to use **1-second candles**, ideal for setting up 5-second trades. Why? Because each candle gives **clear signals for micro trends**.

Look for:

- Three consecutive bullish/bearish candles (microtrend)
- Support or resistance zones in play
- Reversal candlestick patterns

🧠 **Pro tip:** Use candles in conjunction with moving averages or RSI for even sharper confirmation.

### Step 2: Indicators That Matter

The most reliable indicators for this strategy include:

- **RSI (14)** – Look for overbought/oversold areas
- **Bollinger Bands** – Ideal for breakout or reversal signals
- **MACD** – Best when trading divergence setups
- **EMA (5 & 13)** – Great for micro trend confirmation

📌 Indicators aren't magic. Use them to **filter bad trades** and **boost the good ones**.
