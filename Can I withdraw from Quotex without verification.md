## **Why Does Quotex Require Verification?**

To understand the **verification requirement**, we need to zoom out a little and look at the **regulatory environment** for financial platforms. Quotex, like many trading platforms, operates under **international anti-money laundering (AML)** and **know-your-customer (KYC)** regulations. These are global standards imposed to prevent:

- Money laundering
- Identity theft
- Terrorist financing
- Tax evasion
- Fraudulent withdrawals

**Without identity verification**, the platform is exposed to high levels of risk. But more importantly, if you‚Äôre trading with real money and making real profits, you should be prepared to verify your **identity**, **address**, and sometimes **funding sources**.

- ‚úÖ You may be able to deposit and trade **without immediate verification**.
- ‚ùå But when you request a **withdrawal**, especially if it‚Äôs your first, you‚Äôll receive a prompt to verify your account.

- Your **current address**
- The **date**, which must be within the **last 3 months**

### 3. **Payment Method Verification**
