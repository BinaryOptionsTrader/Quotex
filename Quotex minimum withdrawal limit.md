## Why the **Minimum Withdrawal Limit** Matters

For traders who deal in **low capital strategies**, knowing the **minimum withdrawal threshold** helps them set **realistic profit goals**. If you're working with small investments, being able to access your profits once you hit $10 is a huge advantage compared to platforms that require $50 or even $100 as a minimum.

**Example**: Let’s say you're scalping on Quotex with $1 trades and end up making $15 in a day. You’re eligible to **withdraw $10 immediately**, reinvesting the rest or keeping it as buffer capital. This flexibility empowers small traders and helps maintain **cash flow** — a critical component in online trading.

## Real Case Scenarios: How the Limit Works in Practice

Let’s look at three actual user-based situations:

### 1. **Trader A** – Just Getting Started  
Deposited: $20  
Profit after 3 days: $12  
Wants to withdraw: $10  
✅ Eligible: YES  
This is a clear case where the **minimum withdrawal limit** empowers a beginner trader. Within days, the user can access profits and continue trading or cash out completely.

### 2. **Trader B** – International Wire Transfer  
Deposited: $150 via bank transfer  
Wants to withdraw $10  
❌ Eligible? NOT RECOMMENDED  
Here’s the twist. While Quotex allows $10 minimum withdrawal, some payment providers (especially **banks**) might **impose their own minimum limits or fees**. In this case, the trader might be better off waiting to withdraw a larger amount.

### 3. **Trader C** – Crypto Trader  
Deposited: $50 in USDT  
Wants to withdraw: $20  
✅ Eligible: YES  
Since **crypto wallets** are fast and support small transactions, withdrawing small profits via **USDT, Bitcoin, or Ethereum** is both efficient and cost-effective.
