## How Quotex’s Withdrawal System Works

Understanding how Quotex processes withdrawals is key. Here’s what happens behind the scenes:

1. You submit a withdrawal request.
2. The request is reviewed by an **automated algorithm**.
3. If flagged, it goes to a **manual security review**.
4. Funds are processed to the payment method on file.
5. The transaction is routed through local intermediaries (especially for e-wallets or crypto).

Even though the system appears seamless, any hiccup along the way can cause **delays or total blockage**.

## Is Quotex Legit or a Scam?

This is a fair question — especially when money is stuck. Based on 2025 reviews and verifiable user feedback, **Quotex is a regulated and licensed platform** under IFMRRC (International Financial Market Relations Regulation Center). However, it operates in a grey zone in some jurisdictions where **local financial authorities do not oversee** binary options brokers.

So is Quotex legit? Technically, yes. But does that mean your withdrawals are always safe? No — **you need to play smart**.

## Top 10 Withdrawal Problems on Quotex in 2025

Let’s break down the **most common withdrawal issues** users are facing *today*:

### 1. **Pending Verification Documents**
If your account is not fully verified, **your withdrawal will be stalled indefinitely**. Quotex requires:

- Valid ID
- Proof of address
- Payment method verification

Even a mismatch in spelling can cause delays.

### 2. **Bank Transfer Delays**
For local bank transfers, especially in Southeast Asia or Africa, delays can stretch **from 2 to 7 business days**. This is often due to **intermediary banks** doing extra KYC checks.

### 3. **Crypto Withdrawals Rejected**
Yes, crypto is supposed to be fast, but **blockchain congestion**, **wrong wallet formats**, and **internal security scans** can delay or even reject a transaction.

### 4. **Bonus Abuse Flags**
If you accepted a **Quotex bonus**, you’re under strict withdrawal conditions. Failing to meet the turnover requirement will block your funds.

### 5. **Wrong Account Credentials**
It happens more than you think — users input incorrect account details, which results in failed transfers that **may not be refunded automatically**.

### 6. **Unsupported Payment Method**
Not all payment methods available for deposit are available for withdrawal. For instance, local prepaid cards are *deposit-only*. That means you must verify an **alternative withdrawal channel**.

### 7. **Withdrawal Caps**
Quotex has **daily and monthly withdrawal limits** based on your account type. VIP users get higher limits. Standard users often don’t know they’ve hit a cap until a rejection happens.

### 8. **Inactive Accounts**
If your account has been inactive for too long (over 30 days), Quotex may freeze withdrawals pending **activity verification**.

### 9. **Server Maintenance**
Yes, even today. If you’re trying to withdraw during **server sync or maintenance windows**, your request might stall or bounce.

### 10. **Country Restrictions**
In some regions, financial compliance rules force Quotex to manually screen transactions, especially if **anti-money laundering laws** are enforced locally.

There’s no one-size-fits-all solution, but here are **practical actions** you can take *today*:

### ✅ Step 1: Double-Check Verification

### ✅ Step 4: Clear Bonuses Before Withdrawing
Go to your account’s **“bonuses”** tab. Cancel unused bonuses if you're not planning to meet the trading volume.

If it’s been more than **5 working days** with no resolution, prepare:
- Screenshots
- Bank proof
- Email threads

Then send a formal escalation email.

## Are You Losing Your Money?

Probably not. Most withdrawals get delayed, not denied. But if it’s been **over 14 days** and nothing’s moved, here’s what to do:

- **Check your national payment processors**
- **Confirm wallet address is correct**
- **Make noise in trader forums** (Reddit, Trustpilot, FX forums)
- **Use escalation channels** (include IFMRRC complaint form)

---

## Is Quotex Safe for Big Withdrawals?

Short answer: **Only if your account is fully verified and you follow all withdrawal rules.** Large amounts (above $1000) are more likely to be flagged for review. So if you’re scaling your trading, split your profits into **multiple small withdrawals** instead of one large one.

This also avoids:
- Tax triggers
- Banking restrictions
- Internal fraud flags
