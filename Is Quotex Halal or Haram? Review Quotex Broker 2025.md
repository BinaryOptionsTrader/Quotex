# Is Trading on **Quotex** *Halal or Haram*?

üí• **This is the main question.**

In Islamic finance, anything involving *gharar* (excessive uncertainty), *riba* (interest), or gambling (*maysir*) is **Haram**. So, let's check:

- **Gharar**: Trading digital options involves predicting price movements within a time frame. While some scholars argue it's speculative, if a trader uses skill and analysis, it might be seen as a legitimate business activity.
- **Riba**: Quotex does not charge overnight interest fees (swap-free), making it closer to *Halal* standards.
- **Maysir**: If trading is done recklessly like gambling, it's **Haram**. However, strategic, informed trading is considered a business (*mubah*).

‚úÖ **Conclusion:** Trading on **Quotex** can be considered *Halal* if done ethically, with proper analysis, and without gambling mentality.
