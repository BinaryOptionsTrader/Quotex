Quotex is a popular online trading platform that allows traders to trade a wide variety of assets such as forex, stocks, commodities, and cryptocurrencies. Withdrawing money from **Quotex** to your bank account involves several steps that ensure the safety and security of your funds. Before starting the withdrawal process, it's essential to ensure that your account is fully verified.

### Step 1: Account Verification

To comply with security regulations and prevent fraud, Quotex requires all traders to verify their identity before withdrawing funds. This verification process includes providing proof of identity, address, and sometimes payment methods used for depositing funds. Once your identity is verified, you can proceed with the withdrawal process.

#### Common documents for verification:
- A government-issued ID (e.g., passport, driver's license)
- Proof of address (e.g., utility bill, bank statement)
- Payment method verification (if applicable)

Make sure to provide clear and legible copies of the requested documents to avoid delays in the verification process.

### Step 2: Navigating to the Withdrawal Page

Once your account is verified, log into your Quotex account and navigate to the **“Withdraw”** section, typically found in the account settings or payment section. Here you’ll be presented with various withdrawal methods.

- E-wallets (like Skrill, Neteller, etc.)
- Cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum)

If you're withdrawing to your bank account, select the **bank transfer** option and enter the required details such as your account number, bank name, and SWIFT/BIC code.
